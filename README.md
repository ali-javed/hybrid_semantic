Source code for "Hybrid Semantic Clustering of Hashtags"


This repository contains source code for Hybrid Semantic Clustering. 

1. Pull all the source code
2. Pull dummy data file for testing "synth_data" located in /data folder. 
3. Once all your code and data is placed in the same structure as in the repository execute main.py.

Main.py calls multiple scripts. In the end, you will see a cluster_assign folder in the main directory, which will contain hashtags and the cluster number those hashtags are assigned to.

# hybrid_semantic

This repository contains all source codes and datasets, including the gold standards, used in the Hybrid Semantic Clustering project. 

Direction for using the resources:
1. Pull all the source codes.
2. Pull dummy data files for testing "synth_data" located in the /data folder. 
3. Once all your codes and data are placed in the same structure as in the repository, execute main.py.

Main.py calls multiple scripts. At the end, you will see a cluster_assign folder in the main directory, which will contain hashtags and the cluster number those hashtags are assigned to. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Gold Standards for all experiments can be found in the folder archived in data_set_and_gold_standard.zip.
Symplur tweets extracted manually can be found in the same folder (i.e., data_set_and_gold_standard.zip).
Tweets used for GT-All are in the data folder. GT-R1, GT-R2, GT-R3, GT-S1, GT-S2, and GT-S3 are not stored as separate files but can be extracted from GT-All.
